# From https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/README.md
# Incorporating Into An Existing CMake project.
# We use CMake to download GoogleTest as part of the build's configuration step.
# This is more complex, but has fewer limitations than other techniques.

# This file is copied to the build area and then invoked as a sub-build during the CMake stage.
# The directory is then pulled into the main build with add_subdirectory.
